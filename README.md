An automated Bejewled Blitz player made in a hurry.

To use
------
Compile and run. Open Bejewled Blitz in a separate window. Put focus on the bbplayer window and hover the mouse cursor over the top-left position on the Bejewled Blitz board. Hit the `1` key on the keyboard. This should calibrate bbplayer with the Bejewled board.

With the board calibrated, pressing the `2` key will play a single move. Hitting the `3` key will auto-play as fast as possible for 70 seconds. During this 70 seconds, you'll lose control of the mouse, so hang tight.


Known limitations
-----------------
It currently gets mighty confused with hypercubes.
